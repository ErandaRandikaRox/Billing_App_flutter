To create a **README.md** file for the `AddStores` page in your Flutter billing app (`Billing_App_flutter`), we need to provide a clear and concise description of the feature, its purpose, setup instructions, dependencies, and usage details. The README will focus on the `AddStores` page, which allows users to add stores to track bills and expenses, integrates with Firestore for data storage, and includes form clearing after submission (as updated in the latest code, artifact ID `f9bd25c1-3f98-49c8-a961-8d0af1c256d1`). It will also reference related features like `CustomTable` (artifact ID `f329ab99-4893-4eb6-9498-5a9f5c4c5ec1`) and `CustomActionButton` (artifact ID `e10875d9-ba03-4c75-92a9-d49e6336725f`) to provide context within the app.

The README will be written in Markdown, following standard conventions for Flutter projects, and will include:
- Project overview
- Feature description for `AddStores`
- Setup instructions (dependencies, Firebase configuration)
- Usage instructions
- File structure
- Known issues (e.g., `PinniedBill` typo)
- Contributing guidelines
- License information

Since the `AddStores` page is part of a larger app, the README will focus on this specific feature but provide enough context about the app’s purpose (billing and expense tracking) and its integration with other components (e.g., `AuthService`, `FirestoreServices`, `CustomTable`).

# Billing App - Add Stores Feature

## Overview
The Billing App is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to help users manage their expenses by tracking bills and stores. The **Add Stores** feature allows users to add new stores to their account, which can then be used to organize and track bills and items. This feature integrates with Firebase Firestore for persistent data storage and uses a clean, user-friendly interface with custom widgets like `CustomActionButton` and `CustomTable`.

The `AddStores` page is a core component of the app, enabling users to input store details (name, category, address, contact number), save them to Firestore, and view recently added stores. It includes form validation, field clearing after submission, and dynamic data fetching for a seamless user experience.

## Features
- **Add New Store**: Users can input store details via a form with fields for:
  - Store Name (required)
  - Store Category (required, dropdown with predefined options: Grocery, Restaurant, Electronics, Pharmacy, Clothing)
  - Store Address (optional)
  - Contact Number (optional)
- **Form Validation**: Ensures required fields (name, category) are filled before submission.
- **Field Clearing**: Automatically clears all form fields after a successful submission.
- **Firestore Integration**: Saves store data to `users/{userId}/Stores` in Firestore with fields: `name`, `category`, `address`, `contactNumber`, `visits`, `date`.
- **Recent Stores List**: Displays recently added stores, fetched dynamically from Firestore, with details like name, category, and visit count.
- **Custom UI Components**:
  - `CustomActionButton`: A styled button with gradient, shadow, and loading state for adding stores.
  - `CustomAppBar` and `CustomDrawer`: Consistent navigation and branding across the app.
- **Error Handling**: Displays user-friendly error messages for Firestore failures or authentication issues.
- **Loading States**: Shows loading indicators during Firestore operations.

## Prerequisites
- **Flutter**: Version 3.0.0 or higher
- **Dart**: Version 2.17.0 or higher
- **Firebase Account**: For Firestore and Authentication setup
- **IDE**: Android Studio, VS Code, or similar with Flutter plugin
- **Emulator/Device**: For testing the app

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd billing_app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure the following are in `pubspec.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     cloud_firestore: ^4.17.5
     provider: ^6.1.2
   ```
   Run:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase**:
   - Create a Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Enable **Firestore** and **Authentication** (with Email/Password or other providers).
   - Download the `google-services.json` (Android) or `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) and place them in the appropriate directories:
     - Android: `android/app/`
     - iOS: `ios/Runner/`
   - Add Firebase dependencies to `android/build.gradle`:
     ```gradle
     classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.4.2'
     ```
   - Apply the plugin in `android/app/build.gradle`:
     ```gradle
     apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
     ```
   - Initialize Firebase in `main.dart`:
     ```dart
     import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
     import 'firebase_options.dart';

     void main() async {
       WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
       await Firebase.initializeApp(options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform);
       runApp(const MyApp());
     }
     ```

4. **Set Up Firestore Security Rules**:
   Apply the following rules in the Firebase Console to secure the `Stores` collection:
   ```plaintext
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /users/{userId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
         match /Stores/{storeId} {
           allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Run the App**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Usage
1. **Navigate to Add Stores**:
   - Open the app and use the `CustomDrawer` to navigate to the `AddStores` page.
   - Alternatively, access it via a button or link from another page (e.g., home screen).

2. **Add a Store**:
   - Fill in the form:
     - **Store Name**: Enter a unique name (e.g., "Central Market").
     - **Store Category**: Select from the dropdown (e.g., Grocery).
     - **Store Address**: Optional (e.g., "123 Main St").
     - **Contact Number**: Optional (e.g., "+1234567890").
   - Press the "Add Store" button (styled with `CustomActionButton`).
   - If successful, the form clears, and a green `SnackBar` confirms "Store added successfully!".
   - The new store appears in the "Recently Added Stores" section.

3. **View Recent Stores**:
   - Scroll to the "Recently Added Stores" section to see the latest stores.
   - Each store displays its name, category, and visit count.
   - Use the "View All" button to refresh the list.
   - Note: Edit and delete buttons are placeholders and require implementation.

4. **Manage Items**:
   - After adding a store, navigate to the `ItemsPage` to add items for that store (see `CustomTable` feature).
   - Example navigation:
     ```dart
     Navigator.push(
       context,
       MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => ItemsPage(storeId: storeId)),
     );
     ```

## Dependencies
- `flutter`: Core SDK
- `cloud_firestore`: For Firestore integration
- `provider`: For state management (optional, used in related features)
- `firebase_core`: For Firebase initialization
- `firebase_auth`: For user authentication

## Known Issues
- **PinniedBill Typo**: The `CustomDrawer` references `PinniedBill`, likely a typo for `PinnedBill`. To fix:
  - Rename `lib/pages/pinned_bill/pinnied_bill.dart` to `pinned_bill.dart`.
  - Update `CustomDrawer` import:
    ```dart
    import 'package:billing_app/pages/pinned_bill/pinned_bill.dart';
    ```
  - Update navigation:
    ```dart
    Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => const PinnedBill()),
    );
    ```
- **Edit/Delete Buttons**: The edit and delete icons in the recent stores list are placeholders. Implement their functionality as needed.
- **Static Categories**: Store categories are hardcoded. Consider storing them in Firestore for dynamic updates.
